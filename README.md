# The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis Game

Try to memorize the location of numbers 1-9 in ascending order in a certain amount of time.

You can test the game from [here](https://mhdmhsni.github.io/Ai)

## Background

- The idea for this simple game came from a [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ktkjUjcZid0) video with the same name
- The `Ai (愛)` difficulty level is a `real` thing. A chimpanzee named **Ai (愛)**, (in japanese: Love) can play this game with only 0.5s to memorize the numbers in order.

`CAN YOU BE AS GOOD AS AI WITHOUT CHEATING? BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTION, WE DON'T THINK SO. :) ^__^`

## Game Difficulty levels:

- `Human` -> `Easy` : You have 15 seconds to memorize
- `Chimpanzee` -> `Hard` : You have 8 seconds to memorize
- `Ai (愛)` -> `impossible` : Ypu have only half a second to memorize
